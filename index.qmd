Welcome to my **IS415 Geospatial Analytics and Applications** website. In this site, you will be able to view weekly learning, projects, and notes. Stay tuned :)

Below are some important/useful codes and concepts that can be implemented.

## Important/Useful Codes

-   print new line (useful for separating codes)

    ```{r}
    cat("\n")
    ```

    -   e.g

    ```{r}
        cat("5555")
        cat("\n")
        cat("6666")
    ```

-   list all packages with **{ package-name : version number }**

    -   can view packages have been installed and its latest version

    ```{r}

        ip = as.data.frame(installed.packages()[,c(1,3:4)])
        ip = ip[is.na(ip$Priority),1:2,drop=FALSE]
        ip
    ```
